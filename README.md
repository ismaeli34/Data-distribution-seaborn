# Data-distribution-seaborn
📊 Visualizing Data Distributions with Seaborn
This project focuses on Distribution Plots, which are used to visualize the spread and variation of quantitative (numerical) data. By using the Seaborn library, we can easily see how data is concentrated, where the gaps are, and if there are any outliers.

📈 Key Visualizations Included
The notebook demonstrates several essential plots for analyzing data distributions:

Histplot / Distplot: Shows the frequency of data points within specific ranges (bins).

Jointplot: Compares the distribution of two different variables and shows the relationship between them.

Pairplot: Creates a matrix of plots to show distributions and relationships across every numerical column in a dataset.

Rugplot: Adds small vertical ticks along an axis to show exactly where every single data point is located.

📂 Dataset
The project uses the "Tips" dataset (built into Seaborn), which contains 244 records of restaurant data, including:

Total Bill: The cost of the meal.

Tip: The amount given to the server.

Size: The number of people in the dining party.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python: The core language.

Seaborn: For high-level statistical data visualization.

Matplotlib: For managing plot figures and layouts.

🚀 How to Run
Install the necessary libraries: pip install seaborn matplotlib.

Open Distributionplot.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.

Run the cells to generate the charts and explore the data distribution.
